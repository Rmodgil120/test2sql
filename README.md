This project uses RAG to interact with CSV data. 
It allows users to ask natural language questions about the contents of a CSV file, and the system generates SQL queries to extract the relevant information, 
with integrated Google Generative AI and combining document loaders, embeddings, and vector stores for efficient data retrieval.
